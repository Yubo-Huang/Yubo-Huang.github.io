This paper leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to develop an efficient control system for a wind farm comprising a new type of wind turbines with hydrostatic transmission. The primary motivation for hydrostatic wind turbines (HWT) is increased reliability, and reduced manufacturing, operating, and maintaining costs by removing troublesome components and reducing nacelle weight. Nevertheless, the high system complexity of HWT and the wake effect pose significant challenges for the control of HWT-based wind farms. We therefore propose a MARL algorithm named multi-agent policy optimization (MAPO), which allows agents (turbines) to gradually improve their control policies by repeatedly interacting with the environment to learn an optimal operation curve for wind farms. Simulation results based on a wind farm simulator, FAST.Farm, show that MAPO outperforms the greedy policy and a popular learning-based method, multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), in terms of power generation.
