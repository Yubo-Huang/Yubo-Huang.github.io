The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused severe life and economic damage worldwide. Since the absence of medical resources or targeted therapeutics, systemic containment policies have been prioritized but some critics query what extent can they mitigate this pandemic. We construct a fine-grained transmission dynamics model to forecast the crucial information of public concern, therein using dynamical coefficients to quantify the impact of the implement schedule and intensity of the containment policies on the spread of epidemic. Statistical evidences show the comprehensive identification and quarantine policies eminently contributed to reduce casualties during the phase of a dramatic increase in diagnosed cases in Wuhan and postponing or weakening such policies would undoubtedly exacerbate the epidemic. Hence we suggest that governments should swiftly execute the forceful public health interventions in the initial stage until the pandemic is blocked.s
